# Community Bridge Overview

## What is Community Bridge?

Community Bridge is a comprehensive FiveM framework designed to provide modular functionality for server development. It serves as a unified bridge between different systems, resources, and frameworks commonly used in FiveM development.

## Key Features

### 🏗️ Modular Architecture
- **Plug-and-play modules**: Each module can be independently enabled or disabled
- **Flexible configuration**: Extensive configuration options for each module
- **Framework agnostic**: Works with ESX, QBCore, and custom frameworks

### 🔧 Extensive Module Library
- **UI Systems**: HelpText, Notify, Menu, Progressbar
- **Game Systems**: Target, Inventory, Skills, Weather
- **Utility Systems**: Input, Locales, Math, Utility
- **Advanced Features**: Housing, Fuel, Dispatch, Doorlock

### 📚 Rich Library Functions
- **Animation system**: Comprehensive animation controls
- **Entity management**: Advanced entity creation and manipulation
- **Particle effects**: Easy-to-use particle system
- **Database utilities**: Simplified SQL operations
- **Caching system**: Performance-optimized caching

### 🌐 Multi-language Support
Support for 25+ languages with easy localization system:
- English, Spanish, French, German, Italian
- Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean
- And many more...

## Architecture

Community Bridge follows a clean separation between client and server functionality:

### Client-Side (`client.lua`)
- UI interactions and visual effects
- Player input handling
- Local game state management
- Real-time feedback systems

### Server-Side (`server.lua`)
- Data persistence and validation
- Player management
- Cross-player communications
- Security and anti-cheat measures

### Shared (`shared.lua`)
- Common configurations
- Utility functions used by both sides
- Data structures and constants

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Download and install Community Bridge
2. **Configuration**: Configure your preferred modules in `settings/`
3. **Integration**: Integrate with your existing framework
4. **Customization**: Customize modules to fit your server's needs

## Module Structure

Each module follows a consistent structure:

```
modules/
├── moduleName/
│   ├── client.lua      # Client-side functionality
│   ├── server.lua      # Server-side functionality
│   ├── shared.lua      # Shared configuration
│   └── config.lua      # Module-specific configuration
```

## Library Structure

Libraries provide utility functions:

```
lib/
├── libraryName/
│   ├── client.lua      # Client utilities
│   ├── server.lua      # Server utilities
│   └── shared.lua      # Shared utilities
```

## Best Practices

### Performance
- Use caching where appropriate
- Minimize network calls
- Optimize database queries
- Use proper event handling

### Security
- Validate all user inputs
- Use server-side validation
- Implement proper access controls
- Monitor for suspicious activity

### Maintainability
- Follow consistent coding patterns
- Document your customizations
- Use proper version control
- Test thoroughly before deployment
