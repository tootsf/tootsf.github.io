We are building a github page to document the community_bridge modules and lib functions located
within this folder: (C:\Devons_Stuff\Servers\FiveM\COMMISION\[symlink]\community_bridge)

The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide for developers to understand how to use these modules and functions effectively.

Must include dynamic loading of the module data and toc data from the pages folder
each subfolder is a sub category in the navigation on the left
Toc should be displayed on the right and have some way of linking to content on the main page.
There are multiple of the same function names in different modules and server/client side
functions should be clearly distinguished.
Must include a search function to find modules and functions
must have a light and dark mode defaulting to dark.
If it has a markdown file it should display that instead of the .json functions
The documentation should be structured in a way that is easy to navigate and understand
the ui should be modern and user-friendly
I also need the documentation to be easily expanded upon. That means being able to move or create directories and sub directories
without breaking the structure.
