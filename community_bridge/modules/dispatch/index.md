# Dispatch Module
{: .no_toc }

The dispatch module provides emergency services dispatch functionality with support for multiple dispatch systems.

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

1. TOC
{:toc}

---

## ðŸ“š Available Functions

### Client Functions
- [`Send911Call(location, message)`](client/Send911Call.md) - Send a 911 call to dispatch
- [`SendAlert(data)`](client/SendAlert.md) - Send an emergency alert to the dispatch system
---

## ðŸ“š Supported Dispatch Systems

The module automatically detects and integrates with the following dispatch systems:
- ps-dispatch
- cd_dispatch
- bub-mdt
- qs_dispatch
- linden_outlawalert
- tk_dispatch
- lb-tablet
- redutzu-mdt

If no supported dispatch system is found, alerts will be sent to the default notification system.

---

## ðŸ“š Best Practices

### Alert Timing
Don't spam alerts - use appropriate delays between calls:

```lua
local lastAlert = 0

local function SendRobberyAlert()
    local currentTime = GetGameTimer()
    if currentTime - lastAlert < 30000 then -- 30 second cooldown
        return false, "Please wait before sending another alert"
    end
    
    lastAlert = currentTime
    Bridge.Dispatch.SendAlert({
        message = "Store robbery in progress",
        code = "10-90",
        jobs = {"police"}
    })
    return true
end
```

### Location Accuracy
Always provide accurate coordinates for better response:

```lua
-- Get precise player location
local coords = GetEntityCoords(PlayerPedId())

Bridge.Dispatch.SendAlert({
    message = "Suspicious activity reported",
    coords = coords,
    jobs = {"police"}
})
```
