# VehicleKey Module
{: .no_toc }

The VehicleKey module provides a unified interface for managing vehicle keys across multiple popular vehicle key systems in FiveM. It automatically detects and integrates with installed vehicle key resources, providing consistent functionality regardless of the underlying system.

## ðŸ“š Bridge System

The module uses a bridge system that:
1. Checks for installed vehicle key resources using `GetResourceState()`
2. Loads appropriate integration files for detected systems
3. Falls back to default implementation if no system is found
4. Provides consistent API calls regardless of underlying system

---

## ðŸ“š Usage Example

```lua
local Bridge = exports['community_bridge']:Bridge()

-- Give keys to a vehicle
local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId(), false)
local plate = GetVehicleNumberPlateText(vehicle)
Bridge.VehicleKey.GiveKeys(vehicle, plate)

-- Remove keys from a vehicle
Bridge.VehicleKey.RemoveKeys(vehicle, plate)
```

---

## ðŸ“š Integration Benefits

- **Code Portability**: Same code works across different servers with different key systems
- **Easy Migration**: Switch between key systems without changing your scripts
- **Automatic Detection**: No manual configuration needed
- **Fallback Safety**: Functions won't error even without a key system installed
