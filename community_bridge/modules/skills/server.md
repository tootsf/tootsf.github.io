## Database Operations

Database operations involve performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database. Server functions can be used to interact with the database and manipulate data as required by the application.

## Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. Server functions can handle user authentication, including login, registration, and password management.

## Data Processing

Data processing involves performing computations or transformations on data. Server functions can be used to process data, such as generating reports, sending emails, or integrating with external APIs.
